We're always open to enquiries about bioinformaticans, graduate student or postdoctoral positions. In general, we're looking for people with a strong knowledge of immunology or other clinical areas with a understanding of informatics.
</p>
<p>
If you feel you could contribute to the continued success of the Siminovitch team then please submit a short cover letter and CV to Lars Jorgensen (<a href="mailto:lars@innovativemedicine.ca">lars@innovativemedicine.ca</a>).

<h3>Postdoctoral fellows</h3>
<p>
We are seeking postdoctoral fellows who have a strong background in biostatistics, immunology, and/or genomics, to undertake clinically-relevant projects. You will be part of Dr. Kathy Siminovitch’s team at Mount Sinai Hospital’s Office of Personalized Genomics and Innovative Medicine (OPGIM). The OPGIM enables and promotes a personalized health care approach to the diagnosis and treatment of hereditary diseases such cancer, cardiac disease and rheumatoid arthritis. We collaborate closely with our Clinical Genomics Centre (CGC), which provides genomics services (e.g. genotyping and DNA sequencing) to the biomedical community at large, and develops tests in partnership with the hospital’s clinical diagnostics lab. Through ongoing partnerships, the OPGIM aims to implement genetic/genomic discoveries into routine medical practice, improving the speed and precision of disease diagnostics and quality of patient care. 
</p>
<p>
You will be a key member of Dr. Siminovitch’s research lab that is currently generating genomic datasets related to disease onset/severity and treatment response for a wide range of autoimmune diseases. Working with other clinicians, including those at the Rebecca MacDonald Centre for Arthritis and Autoimmune Disease, Dr. Siminovitch has discovered some of the key gene variants conferring risk for rheumatoid arthritis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Coupling its genome-wide studies of human patient cohorts with the generation of unique mouse models, you will be part of a team working to: characterize genes that regulate normal immune responses; define the mechanisms whereby certain proteins contribute to immune system function; and identify the molecular pathways whereby such variants evoke cell dysfunction and disease. Under Dr. Siminovitch’s direction, you will also work with team members of the CGC which provides genotyping and sequencing services and guidance for design of genomics projects aimed at delineating the genetic factors modulating disease risk and outcome.

<b>Qualifications:</b> <br>
MD-Ph.D. or Ph.D. in one of the following fields: bioinformatics, biological sciences, statistics, engineering, or computer science. Additionally, your skillset and experience needs to include:
<ul>
<li>Proven experience working in immunology and auto-immune disease;
<li>Proven experience working with high-throughput data sets (NGS, GWAS);
<li>Experience in computational analysis of biological data;
<li>Significant experience in understanding a disease area and incorporating knowledge into computational results.

<h3>Bioinformaticians</h3>
<p>
We are seeking bioinformaticians to work on the application of high-throughput genomics in clinical care, with a focus on autoimmune diseases. The successful candidate will be responsible for development and implementation of computational methods used with genomic and clinical data to expand the knowledge of autoimmune diseases, guiding experimental work, and eventually informing clinical care.<br>

The ideal candidate has experience with high-throughput biological data and a strong interest in quantitative biology and methods development. Programming experience in at least one scripting language (e.g., Perl, R, python) and/or one compiled language is preferred. We welcome applications from qualified candidates from diverse backgrounds, including biology, anthropology, mathematics, physics, computer science, and related fields.
</p>

<p>
<b>Duties:</b>
<ul>
<li>Development and assessment of bioinformatic tools for identification of genetic changes implicated in autoimmune disease 
<li>Managing locally-produced data and integration with external databases
<li>Development and assessment of bioinformatic tools/methods with clinical utility
<li>Statistical analysis to determine analytical sensitivity and specificity of obtained results
<li>Development of software pipelines for analyzing next-generation sequencing data
<li>Support for research staff by providing analysis and software tools
<li>Contributions to the writing of research publications
</ul>

<p>
<b>Qualifications:</b>
M.Sc. or Ph.D. in one of the following fields: bioinformatics, biological sciences, statistics, engineering, or computer science. <br>
<ul>
<li>Significant experience in bioinformatics software development and support;
<li>Significant experience in implementing bioinformatics algorithms using a high-level language such as R, Perl or Java;
<li>Significant experience in data mining of large-scale biological data sets for the discovery of clinically useful biomarkers;
<li>Significant experience in understanding a disease area and incorporating knowledge into computational results;
<li>At least some experience in use of cluster computing. 
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>The successful candidate will also have:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills
<li>Demonstrated interpersonal skills including the ability to work effectively with others in a team environment, especially within a multi-disciplinary team.
<li>Demonstrated ability to efficiently organize work assignments and establish priorities.
<li>Prior knowledge of autoimmune diseases is a plus.
</ul>


<p>
The Office of Personalized Genomics and Innovative Medicine would like to thank all applicants, however, only those selected for an interview will be contacted.
