			The Office of Personalized Genomics and Innovative Medicine (OPGIM)
			was established at Toronto’s <a href="http://www.mountsinai.on.ca/"
				class="external">Mount Sinai Hospital</a> to enable and promote the
			implementation of a <i>personalized health care</i> approach to the
			diagnosis and treatment of hereditary diseases such cancer, cardiac
			disease and rheumatoid arthritis.
			</p><p>This will be achieved in
			collaboration with our <a href="http://clinicalgenomics.ca">Clinical
				Genomics</a> centre, which has been providing genomics services,
			such as genotyping and DNA sequencing, to the local, national, and
			international biomedical community for over a decade.</p><p>Through ongoing
			partnerships with leading research and molecular diagnostic centres,
			the OPGIM will enable the implementation of exciting genetic/genomic
			discoveries into routine medical practice, and ultimately improve the
			speed and precision of disease diagnostics and the quality of patient
			care.

		<p>Our five major objectives include:</p>
		<ul >
			<li>Implement Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology for
				advanced genetic testing;</li>
			<li>Create and disseminate bioinformatics pipelines for
				biomedical annotation of patients’ genomes;</li>
			<li>Link patient’s genetic data to the Electronic Health
				Records;
			<li>Develop and provide physician decision support tools that
				will integrate disease risk and pharmacogenomics data; and</li>
			<li>Provide patients with access to their genetic information
				while providing appropriate genetic counseling services.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Our mission also aims to:</p>
		<ul >
			<li>Educate the public, government officials and policymakers on
				the economic and personal health benefits of personalized medicine;</li>
			<li>Provide continuous education to medical professionals on
				best phamacogenomic and pharmacogenetic practices in patient care;
			<li>Disseminate knowledge and experience in personalized
				medicine across hospitals and medical centers in Ontario and rest of
				Canada; and</li>
			<li>Provide leadership on public policy issues that affect
				personalized medicine.</li>
		</ul>
